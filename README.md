# gofasting
Gets today's fasting restrictions from The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America.

Jesus said, 'and when you fast, do not look dismal, like the hypocrites, 
for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by men. Truly, I say to you,
they have received their reward. But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,
that your fasting may not be seen by men but by your Father who is in secret;
and your father who sees in secret will reward you:' Matthew 6: 16-18
